# 2-resistor-Voltage-divider
A tiny script just to calculate the required value of resistor for given voltage drop. 
There are 2 different ways you can create voltage divider the first one is using a fixed value resistor on one side and then calcuting the value of second resistor, and the second 
method is to use a fixed pot value that will give a fixed value between the branch, and you have to decide the wiper position, on changing the wiper both values will change, these 
two methods are provided in the scipt.
